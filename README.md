# BCS Sheffield Hackathon - Node Template

TODO: add the task description here

## Getting started

1. Fork the repository
   ![](./docs/fork.png)

2. Open in Gitpod: Add `https://gitpod.io/#` in front of the url to your fork. E.g. if your fork is
   `https://github.com/kamioftea/sheffield-hackathon-node` use 
   `https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/kamioftea/sheffield-hackathon-node` to open your fork in Gitpod.

3. Once Gitpod loads, it should automatically start [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) running in the bottom of your screen. 
   This will watch for code changes and re-run the sample images through your solution when you save your file.

4. Open [index.js](./index.js) and start hacking!
